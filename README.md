ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex. Iâ€™m interested in reinforcement learning and open-endedness for general agents. Iâ€™m currently undertaking a master's in ML at UCL, and will begin a PhD working on world models for robotics at Oxford in October! Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects - reach me at: alexander (dot) inch (dot) 24 at ucl (dot) ac (dot) uk.
